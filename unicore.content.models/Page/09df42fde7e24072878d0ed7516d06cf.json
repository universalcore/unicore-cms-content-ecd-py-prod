You can hide it under a cloth, and say: \u201cwhere does it go\u201d? \u201cIs it still there\u201d? \u201cCan you find it\u201d? \r\n\r\n- You should see an increase in your child\u2019s curiosity and willingness to find out what happened to the object.\r\n\r\n- Tell your infant the names of things and people you are referring to. \r\n\r\n- She/he should show interest and soon will try to make relationships between words and objects or people.\r\n\r\n- Show your child how to say things with hands, like \u201cbye bye\u201d. \r\n\r\n- Soon, your child should try to imitate you and wave \u201cbye-bye\u201d on her/his own, making a relationship between a movement and a vocal expression.\r\n\r\n- Point to the eyes, nose and mouth on a doll. After showing one part on the doll, touch the same part on yourself and on the baby. Take the baby\u2019s hand and have her/him touch the eyes, nose and mouth of the doll you, and her/himself. See the nose on the baby doll? Here is my nose and here is your nose. \r\n\r\n- You should see the baby\u2019s curiosity increase. Slowly, the baby will be able to memorize and identify these different words and relate them to her/his body parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext article:\r\n",
