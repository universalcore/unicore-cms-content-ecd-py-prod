Babies explore and imitate their surrounding environment\r\n\r\n- You can use safe household items to play with your children.\r\n\r\n- Babies like to put things into their mouths because their mouths are sensitive. Using taste and touch helps them learn warm and cool, and soft and hard.\r\n\r\n- 1-3 month old babies see things best when they are between 8-12 inches away. By 3 months, babies have a greater range of vision.\r\n\r\n- Babies like to reach for and grab fingers and objects. \r\n\r\n- Babies look at their hands and feet as if they are just discovering them. This helps them practice eye-hand coordination, and also learn what belongs to their body and what does not.\r\n\r\n- Babies love to see people and faces.\r\n\r\n- Babies enjoy making new sounds, like squeals and laughs.\r\n\r\n- Babies start to learn about how to have a conversation with another person, even before they can say words.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext article:\r\n",
