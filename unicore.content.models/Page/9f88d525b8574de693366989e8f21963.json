Encourage your child to talk: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d \u201cWhere is the window?\u201d Which ball is bigger?\u201d \u201cWould you like the red cup?\u201d You should see your child\u2019s growing interest in interacting with you and trying respond your questions.\r\n\r\n- Read stories to your child and ask him questions about what you see in the book. \r\n\r\nYou should notice that your child memorizes and try to repeat what you read. Your child will be learning from what you make, and will like the toys even more, because they are created by you.\r\n\r\n- Help your child learn to count by asking \u201chow many\u201d and counting things together. \r\n\r\nYour child will make mistakes at first, but learn from repeating things many times.\r\n\r\n- Offer your child circles and other shapes cut from coloured paper to compare and sort.  \r\n\r\nShe/he should be happy to try sorting things and will learn how to match and make relationships between different objects, colours and shapes.\r\n\r\n- Encourage your child to talk and answer your child\u2019s questions. \r\n\r\nYou should observe that your child should be able to understand and handle more and more complex things.\r\n\r\nNext article:",
